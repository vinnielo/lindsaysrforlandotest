                    <p className="text-gray-700">What makes this versatile musician special? What is the magic that begins to build once her fingers touch the strings? Jan has that rare ability to pass along her innate love of the harp to the listener. We become part of the notes, harmony, and rhythm of her seemingly endless repertoire.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700">Jan Jennings was introduced to music with five years of piano lessons as a child. She studied harp with Marie Mellman Naugle in Harrisburg, PA for seven years, but did not intend to pursue the harp as a profession.Jennings chose banking, not music, as her career. However, increasing demand for her talents as a harpist allowed her the unique opportunity to blend vocation with avocation, and she “retired” from her management position to become a full time harpist. For almost ten years, she performed nightly at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress in Orlando.

                        Jan’s background in business continues to serve her well. She was interviewed and quoted in a new book, <a href="www.savvymusician.com">“The Savvy Musician” by Dr. David Cutler</a>.
