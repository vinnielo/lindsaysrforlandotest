Students travel on a regular basis from Gainesville, Merritt Island, Rockledge, Lakeland, Clearwater, Ormond Beach, Port Orange, Deland, and throughout Florida to study with Jan. She requires all students to learn standard classical harp repertoire and theory, but she also teaches arranging and improvisation.</p>
